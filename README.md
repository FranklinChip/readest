- Web: Visit [https://web.readest.com][link-web-readest].

## Requirements

- **Node.js** and **pnpm** for Next.js development
- **Rust** and **Cargo** for Tauri development

For the best experience to build Readest for yourself, use a recent version of Node.js and Rust. Refer to the [Tauri documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for details on setting up the development environment prerequisites on different platforms.

```bash
nvm install v22
nvm use v22
npm install -g pnpm
rustup update
```

## Getting Started

To get started with Readest, follow these steps to clone and build the project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/readest/readest.git
cd readest
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# might need to rerun this when code is updated
pnpm install
# copy pdfjs-dist to Next.js public directory
pnpm --filter @readest/readest-app setup-pdfjs
```

### 3. Verify Dependencies Installation

To confirm that all dependencies are correctly installed, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm tauri info
```

This command will display information about the installed Tauri dependencies and configuration on your platform. Note that the output may vary depending on the operating system and environment setup. Please review the output specific to your platform for any potential issues.

For Windows targets, “Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022” (or a higher edition of Visual Studio) and the “Desktop development with C++” workflow must be installed. For Windows ARM64 targets, the “VS 2022 C++ ARM64 build tools” and "C++ Clang Compiler for Windows" components must be installed. And make sure `clang` can be found in the path by adding `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Tools\Llvm\x64\bin` for example in the environment variable `Path`.

### 4. Build for Development

```bash
# Start development for the Tauri app
pnpm tauri dev
# or start development for the Web app
pnpm dev-web
```

For Android:

```bash
# Initialize the Android environment (run once)
pnpm tauri android init

pnpm tauri android dev
# or if you want to dev on a real device
pnpm tauri android dev --host
```

For iOS:

```bash
# Set up the iOS environment (run once)
pnpm tauri ios init

pnpm tauri ios dev
# or if you want to dev on a real device
pnpm tauri ios dev --host
```

### 5. Build for Production

```bash
pnpm tauri build
pnpm tauri android build
pnpm tauri ios build
```

### 6. Setup dev environment with Nix

If you have Nix installed, you can leverage flake to enter a development shell
with all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
nix develop ./ops  # enter a dev shell for the web app
nix develop ./ops#ios # enter a dev shell for the ios app
nix develop ./ops#android # enter a dev shell for the android app
```

### 7. More information

Please check the [wiki][link-gh-wiki] of this project for more information on development.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Readest Won’t Launch on Windows (Missing Edge WebView2 Runtime)

**Symptom**

- When you double-click readest.exe, nothing happens. No window appears, and Task Manager does not show the process.
- This can affect both the standard installer and the portable version.

**Cause**

- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is either missing, outdated, or improperly installed on your system. Readest depends on WebView2 to render the interface on Windows.

**How to Fix**

1. Check if WebView2 is installed
   - Open “Add or Remove Programs” (a.k.a. Apps & features) on Windows. Look for “Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime.”
2. Install or Update WebView2
   - Download the WebView2 Runtime directly from Microsoft: [link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2?form=MA13LH).
   - If you prefer an offline installer, download the offline package and run it as an Administrator.
3. Re-run Readest
   - After installing/updating WebView2, launch readest.exe again.
   - If you still encounter problems, reboot your PC and try again.

**Additional Tips**

- If reinstalling once doesn’t work, uninstall Edge WebView2 completely, then reinstall it with Administrator privileges.
- Verify your Windows installation has the latest updates from Microsoft.

**Still Stuck?**

- See Issue [readest/readest#358](https://github.com/readest/readest/issues/358) for further details, or head over to our [Discord][link-discord] server and open a support discussion with detailed logs of your environment and the steps you’ve taken.
